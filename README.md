# Importing lifescience data into Neo4j

Here is the material for the "Graph Databases in Life and Health Sciences Workshop" held in Berlin, June 2017. 

The tutorial is around a drug discovery use-case that involves loading a number of life science datasest into Neo4j from a variety of sources, including public SPARQL endpoints. 

You can workthough the tutorial yourself by executing the Neo4j guide. The simplest way to get started is to start a clean sandbox instance of Neo4j from https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/. When setup, simply execute the following command to start the tutorial. 

```
:play https://guides.neo4j.com/life-science-import
```

You can also run this guide in your own Neo4j database, please make sure you have installed the latest set of APOC stored procedures (https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures) before you start. 


The source for the guide is available [here](life-science-import.adoc).
